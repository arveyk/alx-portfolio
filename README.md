<h1>#-!- IoT System for a Greenhouse -!-#</h2>


<p>This is a Portfolio project ment to showcase how much I have learned at ALX SE
It involves, as it states, the creation of a system (internet of things system) that automates the monitoring
and control of conditions within the greenhouse such as temperature, humidity and CO<sub>2<sub> levels.
It relies on sensors present in the greenhouse and the local system being connected to the internet inorder to access it
remotely.
</p>
	<h2>	SCOPE </h2>
<p>This project will only be on the the functionality that starting with the data storage and presentation to the web interface.
deployed independently and then if the need arises, the system and sensors may be incorporated.
</p>
<ul>It covers;
<li> the user interface where the user can monitor the parameters</li>
<li> the backend function that store data and converts and presents data in a meaningful form</li>
</ul>

<p> Usage:<br>
This interface is ment to be accessed via a browser since a browser is available in both phones and personal/desktop computers
</p>
